My name is Junyu Wang (pronounces JOON-yoo WAWNG), I am a Senior Software Engineer @ [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/).

A little bit about me, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A degree in Computer Science in 2017 :bear:, and writing software has been my passion since the first CS class ([CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/), Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) I took in my freshman year. During my free time, I enjoy reading, watching Netflix just like a billion others, and I also have been aspiring to work out :basketball:more but rarely put it into actions (also just like a billion others).

The reason I want to start this blog is because I like the experience of digging into unfamiliar code and trying to understand it like solving a puzzle. I am also a firm believer that reading quality code written by others is the most effective way for an engineer to grow. Therefore I will start blogging about interesting code I encounter, papers I scratch my head about, or just any random things.
